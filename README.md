# Carlos fonts

## Description

Carlos is a font built by [Ethan C](https://github.com/ethanc8) derived
from Lato, designed by [Łukasz Dziedzic](https://github.com/typoland), that is metric-compatible
with Calibri.

It comes with Latin and Cyrillic character sets.

## History

More detailed history is available in [google/fonts#1441](https://github.com/google/fonts/issues/1441#issuecomment-754068542).

Carlito was built by Łukasz Dziedzic using a large amount of proprietary tools which transformed the Lato TTFs such that their metrics would match Calibri. These were copied into this repository, renamed Carlos, and the double-storey italic *g* was replaced by a custom single-storey *g* to look more similar to Calibri. The double-storey italic *g* was moved to the stylistic alternate `g.salt`.

## TODO

* [ ] Verify metric compatibility
* [ ] Develop a Carlos-Light
